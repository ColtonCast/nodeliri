# nodeliri

Welcome! I normally don't even read the README files but according to github it's often the first thing visitors see! I must be doing it wrong! 
Liri has a few simple commands and they are:

1. spotify-this-song <"name of song">
    searches for the name of a song looks up 5 of the most popular songs on spotify and returns the name of artist, song, album.

2. movie-this <"name of a movie">
    returns movie info from the omdb api info includes, Title, Year, Genre, imdb rating, actors and the full plot.

3. do-what-it-says <"any text you would like to be saved to random.txt">
    stores the string of text your write and if you use it again it will read back the text that has been written to it. like a really bad planner!

4. concert-this <"band name">
    this still needs some work the bands in town api is part of the swagger hub api? i'm not sure but i got 404 trying to look for the bands in town.

if you don't give a command that liri understands it will tell you that it isn't very smart!
